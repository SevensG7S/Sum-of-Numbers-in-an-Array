📌 This program calculates the sum of numbers from **1 to n**.  

🔹 **How it works:**  
1️⃣ The user enters a number **n** (the length of the array).  
2️⃣ The program creates an array with numbers from **1 to n**.  
3️⃣ It adds all these numbers together.  
4️⃣ Finally, it displays the total sum.  

📝 **Example:**
